## Analysis of my GitHub Profile

### Overview

- Total public repositories: 2
- Commits: 41

### Coding Habits

My coding habits are not well-reflected by the commit graph as there is no consistent pattern of commits. However, despite the lack of consistency in commit frequency, I am passionate about programming and always strive to improve my skills.

### Projects

I have created two personal repositories, namely "labs" and "tic-tac-toe." Although these repositories do not have descriptions, they showcase my diverse programming skills and interests across different programming languages like Ada, C, Python, and C++. However, these projects are still in their early stages and have not gained significant recognition or contributions.

### GitHub Presence

With no followers and no users followed, my GitHub presence is still minimal. I am actively looking to engage with the GitHub community, collaborate on projects, and learn from experienced developers. Moving forward, I intend to contribute more to other projects to expand my network and gain recognition.

## Skills & Interests

- Programming Languages: Ada, C, Python, and C++
- Technologies: I strive to stay up-to-date with new technologies and tools in the software development industry.
